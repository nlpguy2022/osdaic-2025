# EY Open Science Data and AI Challenge 2025
* The objective of this challenge was to help develop AI models to help combat Climate Change
* In this year's challenge, we explored modelling and identifying Urban Heat Islands in New York City
* Our team's goal was to develop the best model to predict the Urban Heat Index (UHI) for a given location in New York City, noted by its coordinates in Latitude and Longitude
* With this information, we were to extract out certain geospatial data to help us infer the UHI using a regression model
* Ultimately, we developed a regression model using the Extra Trees Regressor with an R2 score of 0.9774 to accurately predict the UHI for this challenge, landing us at the top 20 globally in the challenge (#18).
